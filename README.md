## Password Generator
This project aims to generate a random password of user input length using the [**`secrets`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) and `string` module. The reason I've used `secrets` module is that it increases the security. 
#### Output

## Dice Simulator
This is considered as the most basic project in python. I have used the `time` and `random` module in this project. Basically, [this](Dice-Simulator) project is all about generating a random number in the range of 1 to 6 for some number of times(attempts) and lastly displaying the total score with the attempts.

## Dice Game
This project uses the concept of [Dice Simulator](Dice-Simulator/dice_simulator.py). [This](Dice-Game) game supports multi-players and multi-rounds.

## Word Cloud Generator
Word Cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance. Significant textual data points can be highlighted using a word cloud. Word clouds are widely used for analyzing data from social network websites. We'll be using `pandas`, `wordcloud` and `matplotlib` modules of Python.  
- `pandas` to read data file which includes words for generating word cloud.
- `matplotlib` to plot word cloud figure.
- `wordcloud` to generate wordcloud.
